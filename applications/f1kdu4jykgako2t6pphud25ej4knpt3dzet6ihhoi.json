    "Brief history of your project and organization": "Water Observations from Space (WOfS) beta version product for Water Observations from Space (WOfS) is an annual summary of the temporal and spatial extent of surface water over landscapes. In essence, this highlights where water is usually or where it is rarely. The results are visualised to compare points in time spanning over a year, a season or multiple years. The dataset extends back historically to 2013.",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
