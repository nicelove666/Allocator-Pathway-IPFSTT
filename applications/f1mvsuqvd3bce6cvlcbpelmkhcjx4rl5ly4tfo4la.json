    "Brief history of your project and organization": "YouTube-8M Segments was released in June 2019 with segment-level annotations. Human-verified labels on about 237K segments on 1000 classes are collected from the validation set of the YouTube-8M dataset. Each video will again come with time-localized frame-level features so classifier predictions can be made at segment-level granularity.\n\nYouTube-8M was updated in May 2018 to include higher-quality, more topical annotations, and to clean up the annotation vocabulary. A number of low-frequency or low-quality labels and associated videos were removed, resulting in a smaller but higher-quality dataset (5.6M videos, 3862 classes). Additionally, the video IDs in the TensorFlow Record files have been anonymized, and the mapping to the real YouTube IDs will be periodically updated to exclude any videos that have been subsequently deleted (while preserving their anonymized features).",
    "Is this project associated with other projects/ecosystem stakeholders?": "No",
