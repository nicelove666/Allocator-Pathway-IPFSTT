    "Brief history of your project and organization": "EMPIAR, the Electron Microscopy Public Image Archive, is a public resource for raw images underpinning 3D cryo-EM maps and tomograms (themselves archived in EMDB). EMPIAR also accommodates 3D datasets obtained with volume EM techniques and soft and hard X-ray tomography. More ...\nAs of 2025-03-19, EMPIAR contains 2062 entries, taking up 5.28 PB of storage.\n\nEMPIAR (https://empiar.org/ or https://www.ebi.ac.uk/empiar), the Electron Microscopy Public Image Archive, is a public resource for raw images underpinning 3D cryo-EM maps and tomograms (themselves archived in EMDB). EMPIAR also accommodates 3D datasets obtained with volume EM techniques and soft and hard X-ray tomography. All data archived in EMPIAR can be re-used freely without any conditions or restrictions (\"CC0\" license model). Detailed information about EMPIAR policies and procedures is available.\nThe purpose of EMPIAR is to provide easy access to state-of-the-art data to facilitate methods development, validation and re-use, e.g., for Machine Learning applications. EMPIAR data is also used for training and teaching purposes and as part of community challenges.\nEMPIAR owes much to input from the EM community, notably at two workshops organised by EMBL-EBI and the Open Microscopy Environment (OME) - \"Data Management Challenges in Three-dimensional EM\" (Patwardhan et al., Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 19, 1203-1207 (2012)) and \"A 3D Cellular Context for the Macromolecular World\" (Patwardhan et al., Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 21, 841-845 (2014)). We are developing a timeline with highlights of EMPIAR's history.",
