# Filecoin Plus DataCap Allocator - Client Applications

Welcome to the IPFSTT  Allocator GitHub repository dedicated to managing the Lifecycle Data Notations (LDN) Applications for a specific Filecoin Plus DataCap allocator team. This repository serves as a public ledger for DataCap allocation requests and tracking, facilitating transparency and efficiency in the process.

### Requesting DataCap

1. **Open an Issue:** Clients looking to request DataCap must open a new issue in this repository. The issue should include detailed information about the project requiring DataCap. Essential information includes but is not limited to:
   - Project name and description
   - Amount of DataCap requested
   - Justification for the DataCap amount
   - Information about the data owner for KYC

2. **Filling the Application Template:** An issue template will guide clients through submitting the necessary information for their DataCap request.

### Review and Allocation Process

1. Reject redundant data. Client needs to submit a new public data set, and we will verify it in many ways.

2. Verification of data set size and reasonable total data application. Client needs to provide proof of data set size. If the client cannot provide it, we have developed a query tool. After the query, we will tell the client what the data set size is. The total amount requested = data set size x number of SPs.
   
3. Detailed technical solutions. We will focus on the data processing solution, how the data is processed, how it is cut, which part of the data is downloaded, and how the data matches the sector data. How do we verify. This includes asking the client and SP to provide index information.
   
4. Pay attention to who the client is, whether the data set has been applied for in other allocators, and whether the data set applied for by the client in other allocators is the same as the data set applied for in our allocator. In principle, we will reject such applications.
   
5.After the first round of approval to the client, we will download the sectors and review the data, and ask the them to explain how the data we downloaded matches the original data.

6.We will require SPs to be distributed in three continents. Although this is very difficult, we also strive to find SPs in other continents and provide assistance to clients.

7. When we have objections to an application, we will ask the client to provide an ID card and more proof. If we have other communications with the client when handling the questions, we will synchronize these contents on GitHub or send them to the governance team's email.

### Dispute Resolution Mechanism

Response Time: 24 hours

Action: Immediately halt allocations, file a dispute, and wait for both parties to submit evidence and for the dispute to be resolved.
If the issue is serious, seek assistance from our official technical team to reclaim unused DataCap quotas.

Immediately shut down LDN.

Blacklist the client/SP from future allocations.

If necessary, support video conferencing, phone calls, email, and Slack communication to resolve the issue.

If necessary, we will escalate the issue to the governance team and await resolution.
